# 🧠 GridGod - The Unbeatable Connect-4 AI

> An AI-powered Connect-4 game built in Go — inspired by a real-life defeat and fueled by redemption. The goal? To never lose again.

## 📦 Project Status

🚧 **Under Construction** — Building a perfect Connect-4 AI using Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning, fully playable via web.

## 🔮 Vision

This project aims to:

- Implement a powerful AI that always plays optimally.
- Expose the AI through a RESTful API.
- Design a sleek web interface to challenge the AI.

## 🛠️ Planned Tech Stack

- **Language**: Go (Golang)
- **AI Logic**: Minimax + Alpha-Beta Pruning
- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript (or maybe a lightweight JS framework)
- **Backend Server**: Go net/http or Fiber
- **Deployment**: Fly.io / Render / Railway

## 📅 Timeline

| Date | Goal |
|------|------|
| Day 1 | Build core game logic + CLI-based AI |
| Day 2 | Implement Alpha-Beta Pruning + Web API |
| Day 3 | Add frontend, polish UX, deploy |

## 🧠 Why?

Connect-4 is a **solved game**. With perfect play, the first player can always win. This AI will make sure of it — using logic, recursion, and some good ol’ Go code.
